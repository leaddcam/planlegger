save user login information in database
- email + username 
- password (hashed)
tie all information to user
- home page (list of emner and interesser and all information tied to all pages within said categories)

how?
- in App.jsx:
    implement AuthProvider to tie all pages to username
    /login
        page: Login
    /signup
        page: SignUp
    /home
        page (protected): element={<ProtectedRoute><Home /></ProtectedRoute>}
- install packages: 
    npm i argon2 jsonwebtoken cookie-parser cors nodemailer
- alter database:
    run script in userLogin.sql
- alter server.js:
    const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
    specific cors setup
- auth middleware
    backend/middleware/auth.js
- auth routes (register, verify, login, logout, me)
    backend/routes/auth.js
- apply "INSERT, set user_id = req.user.id"
    on  "SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE, add AND user_id = $X"
    on all routes to tie them to user data.
- new .env base url 
- API helpers:
    frontend/src/api/client.ts
    frontend/src/auth/AuthContext.tsx
    frontend/src/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx
- wire notes etc to logged-in user
    filter by user_id


user login/signup flow:
    Sign up: user enters email+password 
    => you hash the password and save the user with email_verified = false 
    => you create a one-time verification token, email it 
    => user clicks link 
    => you mark email_verified = true and (optionally) log them in.

    Log in: user enters email+password 
    => you verify against the stored hash (you do not save the password again) 
    => set a session cookie 
    => show the user’s notebooks/notes (scoped by user_id).
